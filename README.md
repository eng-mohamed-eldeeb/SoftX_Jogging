# user

Endpoint  | Method | Description | ex
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
/signup  | POST | This create a user. return a token |    "user": {   "email": "user@example.com",   "password": "12345678",  "role": "user" }}
/logout  | DELETE | this revokes the token |  N/A
/users/login  | POST | This gets the new token if the user loggedout. NOTE: donâ€™t forget to remove the Authorization from the header before send the post requset | {  "user": {    "email": user@example.com",    "password": "12345678"  }}
/current_user  | GET | this return the current user |  N/A
/jogging_times  | POST | This creates a jogging time for the current_user. NOTE:the user token must be included. NOTE: the admin user create it for other users but has his own routes | {  "jogging_time": {      "date": "2023-05-10",      "distance": "5. miles",      "time": "2023-05-10T07:30:00Z"    }}

/jogging_times/4  | PUT | This updates the jogging time  the id is the jogging time id |  {"jogging_time": {      "date": "2023-05-10",      "distance": 8.5 miles",      "time": "2023-05-10T07:30:00Z"    }}


 Now there is user and jogging time. Lets do something about that

# admin


Endpoint  | Method | Description | ex
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
/signup  | POST | This creates a special user with admin. Thins returns the token. By using this token we can a lot of things | {  "user": {"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "12345678",  "role": admin"  }
/jogging_times/add-jogging-times-to-user  | POST | By using an admin user token we can add the jogging times of a user. In this example we added a record to this user. | {"jogging_time": {      "date": "2023-05-10",      "distance": "c miles",      "time": "2023-05-10T07:30:00Z",      "user_id": 2    }}
/jogging_times/update-jogging-times-to-user/4 | PUT | This update the jogging time of a certain user. It can also change the id of the user. The id is for the jogging time id |  {  "jogging_time": {      "date": 2023-05-10",      "distance": "50 miles",      "time": 2023-05-10T07:30:00Z",      "user_id": 1    }}
/jogging_times/show-jogging-times-to-user/1  | GET | This returns the jogging times of a certain user. |  N/A
/jogging_times/remove-jogging-times-to-user/1  | DELETE | this delete a jogging time for any user. The id is the jogging time id |  N/A

now letâ€™s create a user manager

# user Manager

Endpoint  | Method | Description | ex
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
/signup  | POST | This returns the token of the user manager. |    "user": {   "email": "user_manger@example.com",   "password": "12345678",  "role": "user_manager" }}

The user manager CRUDs the users. NOT the users records. NOTE the admin can do the same. Create some users like we did in the first step so we can proceed. Add jogging times as well. With the power of the user manager token we can:


Endpoint  | Method | Description | ex
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
/users/update/5  | PUT | this revokes the token |  {  "user": {    "email": "usasder@example.com",    "password": "12345678",    "role": "user"  }}
/users/show/5  | GET | returns the a certain user. |  N/A
/users/destroy/5  | DELETE | deletes the user with the id of 5. |  N/A
/users/filter_jogging_times_by_dates  | GET | This Filter by dates from-to. NOTE: the ID is the user id | {    "id": 5,    "start_date": "2020-01-01",    end_date": "2023-12-30"  }
/users/weekly_report/6  | GET  | Report on average speed & distance per week for a user with the id 6 |  N/A
